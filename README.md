### Utility for creating directories using JSON
* Clone the repo
* Edit JSON file according to your required folder structure. Please do not use array of objects [{},{},...], use only objects. Each key works as folder name. So, for leaf folder's key give the value "/".
* Edit separator according to your OS environment: '\\' for windows and '/' for linux
* Enter root directory where you want to create the folders.
